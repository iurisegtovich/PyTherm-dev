# About the project

[![scipy plus atoms](figs/scipy-plus-atoms.PNG)](figs/scipy-plus-atoms.PNG)

* Our main goal is to develop and publish open source interactive computational course materials for students of Applied Thermodynamics and make them widely available.

* We do so on top of the *SciPy* stack -- a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. *(We are not affiliated with or endorsed by SciPy.org nor all the other great open source platform that we make use of and highlight here in any way.)*

# Courseware content

[![graphical abstract](figs/graphical-abstract.PNG)](figs/graphical-abstract.PNG)

* Find here our courseware content, access in any of the three following ways:

---

## Read statically

[![statically](figs/statically.PNG)](figs/statically.PNG)

* Reading our material statically in web page format is straightforward from your browser:

[ > Read statically online ](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }}/blob/master/index.ipynb)

---

## Read interactively

[![interactively](figs/interactively.PNG)](figs/interactively.PNG)

 * You can also run our material remotely on myBinder. Try them also from your browser:

[< ! > Check the system status](http://mybinder.org/status)

[ >_ Main lectures - Read interactively](http://mybinder.org:/repo/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }})

## Setup locally

[![locally](figs/locally.PNG)](figs/locally.PNG)

* Download our whole content package, either as zip or as tar.

[< ZIP > Download](http://github.com/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }}/zipball/master)

[< TAR >  Download](http://github.com/{{ site.github.owner_name }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }}/tarball/master)

* To run locally and develop on top of our content, we recommend setting up Python and the SciPy stack using the anaconda distribution.

# Models & algorithms laboratory

[![M&A laboratory](figs/mnalab.PNG)](figs/mnalab.PNG)

* On our models & algorithms laboratory, we intend to publish well documented and open source implementations of topics of interest in thermodynamics for intermediate level students in thermodynamics and in programming / scientific computing, with complete reference to original journal or textbook publications. This way objective quantitative comparison of classic, stated-of-art and newly proposed methodologies is possible.
